A discord bot that build discord servers.

I made this bot for fun when I was still learning the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> (Python Library for making discord bots). Anyone who want to contribute to the project and add new 
features, just fork it, update it, and make a pull request.
